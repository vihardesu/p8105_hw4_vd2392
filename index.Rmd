  <p>That's my mom on the left at my Blues-Clues themed birthday party when I was 3. That face you see there is pretty much the face I make all the time (blank). I'm currently studying genetics at Columbia and working at a start-up called Pomerium. You can find another one of  my personal sites built in React JS, [here](https://www.vihardesu.com/). You can learn more about me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vihar-desu/) or read my blog at [Medium](https://medium.com/@vihardesu)!</p>
